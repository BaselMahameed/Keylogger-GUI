The required task: To build a keylogger that logs every keystroke and captures mouse movements
and it's clicks.

In order to accomplish the needed task we used the programming language C++ and as for the 
enviroment we used visual studio. 

KeyLogging: 
In order to log every key pressed we used the ASCII table and c++ conditions to check the pressed
button's value, the logging process was maintained in a file.
To begin the logging our user presses the "Begin logging" button on his screen as for the 
quitting logging, our user is required to press the wheel button on th mouse. 

MouseLogging: 
In order to log every mouse movement, we used a built in class named POINT, to get every coordinantes 
of every mouse movement across the screen, as for the left and right click, we again used the
ASCII table to capture them. 
For the logging to begin our user is required to press the begin logging button on his screen as 
for quitting the logging, our user is asked to press the "ESC" known as escape button. 

*P.S: 
Files Location in attached files: 
Inside of the attached "test/test" there'll be;
MyForm.cpp & MyForm.h 
Those are code files. 

We hope you enjoy our program and thank you for your time ^.^
